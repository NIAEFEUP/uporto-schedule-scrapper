# Database 

This folder contains two important files:

- `create_db_sqlite3.sql`: This file should not be deleted. It contains the sql schema and used to generate the `sqlite3` database.
-  `database.db`: this is the sqlite3 database. It's generated once the program is executed and can be deleted using `make clean`.
